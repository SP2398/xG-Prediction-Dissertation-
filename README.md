Enhanced Expected Goals (xG) Prediction Models

Overview

This project focuses on the development of machine learning models to enhance the prediction accuracy of Expected Goals (xG) in football analytics. Traditional xG models typically rely on core parameters like shot distance and angle to the goal, but often overlook other influential factors such as psychological elements, player-specific attributes, and team dynamics. By incorporating these advanced features, our models provide a more comprehensive and accurate prediction of xG.

Dataset

The dataset consists of 257,800 shot events from top European football leagues, including:

	•	Premier League
	•	La Liga
	•	Serie A

The data spans from 2014 to 2023 and includes detailed contextual factors for each shot event.

Models

We utilized the following machine learning models to develop the enhanced xG predictions:

	•	Logistic Regression
	•	Gradient Boosting
	•	Neural Networks
	•	Ensemble Methods

Key Features

	•	Traditional xG Features: Distance, angle to goal, etc.
	•	Advanced Features: Psychological factors, player-specific attributes, team dynamics.
